## About Me

I am a fourth year PhD student advised by [Ryan Stutsman](http://rstutsman.github.io/) at
the [University of Utah](http://www.cs.utah.edu/). I enjoy designing, building, and evaluating large scale systems.

I am currently working with [Badrish Chandramouli](http://badrish.net/) on scaling out the [FASTER](https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/) key-value store. I also work on an experimental many-core operating system with [Gerd Zellweger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerdzellweger) and [Irina Calciu](https://cs.brown.edu/people/irina/).

Previously, I built [Splinter](http://utah.systems/projects/kulkarni_splinter), a low-latency key-value store that can be extended with type- and memory-safe extensions at runtime, and [Rocksteady](http://utah.systems/projects/kulkarni_rocksteady), a fast migration protocol for low-latency stores that helps preserve tail latency during reconfiguration. Both projects were in collaboration with [Robert Ricci](http://ricci.io/) at Utah.

I am generously supported by a [Google PhD fellowship](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/announcement-of-2019-fellowship.html), mentored by [Atul Adya](https://ai.google/research/people/AtulAdya). I have interned at [VMware Research](https://research.vmware.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2F).
