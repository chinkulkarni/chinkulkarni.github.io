{\bf Lightstep (acquired by Servicenow)} \dotfill Remote, Salt Lake City, USA \\
{\small\em Senior Software Engineer, Data Platform Team, June 2021 -
November 2023} \\
{\small Member of the data platform and query experience teams. Worked
on Lightstep's in-house timeseries databases, query engine, query
language, and public APIs (for spans, metrics, and traces).} \\

\vspace{-1pt}
{\small
Notable projects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Led a project to build a service-graph-connector for
OpenTelemetry. Designed and built an API that queries spans and metrics
telemetry to determine the set of kubernetes resources running within a
customers' environment. Generated multiple million dollars of pipeline
across many big name enterprise customers for Lightstep. When released on
the ServiceNow store, broke the record for the most downloaded connector.
\item Led a project to build a query logging system to identify queries of death.
Paired with teammate for the implementation. Reduced incident
MTTR from hours to minutes. Logger is also now
used to guide improvements to the query layer. Logger also powers key
product feature that allows customers to reduce cost by identifying unused
timeseries.
\item Worked on a team to migrate data from spanner into an in-house
database. Designed and built a fault-tolerant, idempotent, highly-concurrent,
distributed ETL job for the migration. Validated data post-migration.
Helped root cause and fix issues caused by the migration.
Reduced yearly operating cost by 0.5 million dollars.
\item Made contributions to the query engine and language including
support for template variables etc. Sheparded tweaks to cluster
autoscaler, reducing yearly operating cost by 1 million dollars.
Built dashboards to measure unit margins. Embedded within product team
to implement product features for alerting.
